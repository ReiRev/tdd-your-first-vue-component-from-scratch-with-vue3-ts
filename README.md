### 01 TDD Your First Vue Component From Scratch

#### TODO

- [ ] Initialize a Vue project using npm create vue@latest.
- [ ] Create a test: "Counter defaults to a count of 0," and make it pass.
- [ ] Create a test: "Increments the count when the button is clicked," and make it pass.
- [ ] Create a test: "Presents the current count," and make it pass.

#### Key Points

- Setting up the development environment.
- Testing Vue Components.
- Typing the wrapper.

### 02 Test Single File Component

You can skip this chapter since I have already made the Counter as a Single File Component (SFC).
