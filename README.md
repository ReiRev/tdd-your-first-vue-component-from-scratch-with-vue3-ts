## TODO & Key Points

### 01 TDD Your First Vue Component From Scratch

#### TODO

- [ ] Initialize a Vue project using npm create vue@latest.
- [ ] Create a test: "Counter defaults to a count of 0," and make it pass.
- [ ] Create a test: "Counter increments the count when the button is clicked," and make it pass.
- [ ] Create a test: "Counter presents the current count," and make it pass.

#### Key Points

- Setting up the development environment.
- Testing Vue Components.
- Typing the wrapper.

### 02 Test Single File Component

You can skip this chapter since I have already made the Counter as a Single File Component (SFC).

### 03 Setting Data and Asserting Styles

#### TODO

- [ ] Change "the button is clicked" test to "the increment button is clicked" test.
- [ ] Create a test: "Counter decrements the count when the decrement button is clicked," and make it pass.
- [ ] Create a test: "Counter never goes below zero," and make it pass.
- [ ] Set the value of count directly in arranging test instead of calling multiple click.

#### Key Points

- `only` API.
- How to change ref directly.
